# Welcome!

I am a PhD student in the School of Computing and Information systems at the [University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au), specializing in **clinical data science**. My research involves the application of **artificial intelligence(AI)** and **process mining** within clinical settings to improve patient care and outcomes. I‚Äôm really passionate about **computer science** and **biomedical informatics**, and I love using new technology to make healthcare better for everyone. Currently,I focus on designing scalable data pipelines to measure and visualize variability in healthcare processes. I am supervised by [A/Prof Daniel Capurro Nario](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/852679-daniel-capurro-nario) from [Center for Digital Transformation of Health](https://mdhs.unimelb.edu.au/digitalhealth) and [Dr.Abel Armas Cervantes](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/822941-abel-armas-cervantes) from the School of Computing and Information Systems at the University of Melbourne.

[Parsing Eligibility Criteria for Cohort Query by a Multi-Input Multi-Output Sequence Labeling Model](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11251129/pdf/nihms-2007993.pdf)

- To enable electronic screening of eligible patients for clinical trials, free-text clinical trial eligibility criteria should be translated to a computable format. **Natural language processing (NLP)** techniques have the potential to automate this process. In this study, we explored a supervised multi-input multi-output (MIMO) sequence labelling model to parse eligibility criteria into combinations of fact and condition tuples. Our experiments on a small manually annotated training dataset showed that that the performance of the MIMO framework with a BERT-based encoder using all the input sequences achieved an overall lenient-level AUROC of 0.61.
- This study is funded in part by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) through awards: R21 AG068717 and R21 CA253394.
